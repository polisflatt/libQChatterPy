# libQChatterPy
The Python library for interfacing with the QChatter server program. 

Documentation coming soon, I've got a lot to push to GitHub right now. Been making programs, but have not been uploading them.
Hopefully I can get all of the documentation done soon (i.e., rest API documentation, QChatterServer plugin documentation, and libQChatterPy documentation too, not to mention the other libraries which are ports to JS and C).
